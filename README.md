# IdentifAIer

## Overview
IdentifAIer is an AI-powered object detection web application built using Streamlit. This app uses a pre-trained YOLO model to identify objects in images, and store detection history. Users can upload images, detect objects, and view the frequency of detected objects over time through a dynamic bar chart.

## Features:
1. Object Detection: Upload images and detect objects using the YOLO model.
2. History Management: Save and view the history of detected objects.
3. Data Visualization: Display a bar chart showing the frequency of detected objects.
4. Firebase Integration: Store history and images in Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Storage.
